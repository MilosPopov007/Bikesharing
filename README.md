Last summer, I and my friend Kate took the trip of a lifetime, New York City, for two full weeks, exploring the historic landmarks like Central Park, the Statue of Liberty, Broadway and the Empire State Building. It was a magical experience, and as we flew home together, we looked through our vacation photos and had a realization. One of the key ingredients to the magic was an unlikely suspect "City bike". Me and Kate had biked everywhere, which allowed us to really get to know the city and interact with the people who live there and who are using bikes for their commutes. A gem of an idea starts to form in our mind. What if we could start a similar bike share business in our hometown Colorado. This is an exciting prospect, but I know, we have to think realistically, the mechanics of making this business work might be quite different in Colorado than in New York City. We decided that the first step is to figure out how the bike share business actually works in New York City. Kate is gregarious, friendly, and fearless. She is definitely the face of our proposal.

## Results:

For this project, we'll use data from the Citi Bike ([https://citibikenyc.com/](https://citibikenyc.com/)) program in New York City. This data includes a variety of fields ([https://citibikenyc.com/system-data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data)) stored in a flat file, a CSV.
